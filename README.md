# Weather Station

Work in progress

Project of weather station based on STM32L476RG board using TFT display and sensors - DHT11 and LPS25HB. 
## Installation

To get the repo use:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/simooon0422/weather-station
```
Then navigate to repo's folder
```bash
  cd .../weather-station
```
## Roadmap

- Add bluetooth communication between STM32 and AVR microcontroller

- Use AVR microcontroller to create mobile weather station communicating with the main station

- Add displaying values and charts of both stations on TFT display

- Add power saving solutions
